# Project Management Feature Implementation

## Backend Implementation
- [x] Add Project, Phase, Activity models in src/api/models.py with hierarchical relationships and fields (WBS, durations, predecessors, weights, dates)
- [x] Add CRUD API endpoints for projects in src/api/routes.py (list, create, update, delete projects with nested phases/activities)
- [ ] Test backend API endpoints for project management

## Frontend Implementation
- [x] Create src/front/js/pages/ProjectsPage.jsx (main project page with list and status visualization)
- [ ] Create src/front/js/component/project/ProjectCard.jsx (project display component)
- [ ] Create src/front/js/component/project/ProjectForm.jsx (project creation form with WBS, phases, activities)
- [x] Update src/front/js/store/flux.js to add project actions and state management
- [x] Add navigation link to projects page in src/front/js/component/navbar.jsx or layout.js

## Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate frontend components with backend API via flux store
- [ ] Test full flow: project creation, listing, status display, phase determination
- [ ] Handle project status calculation based on "Avance Real %" (real progress %)
