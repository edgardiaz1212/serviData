# TODO: Add last_login display to user list

- [x] Update src/front/js/pages/UserRegistrationPage.jsx to display last_login for each user in the list
- [x] Verify src/front/js/store/flux.js handles last_login in user state (likely no changes needed)
- [ ] Test the changes by running the app and verifying last_login appears in the user list
